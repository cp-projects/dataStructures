# dataStructures

Making an archive (.a) and/or shared object file (.so) with common data structures:

working:

    singly linked list stored on the heap:
    
        create() -- creates an empty list object with a head pointer to NULL and a size of 0
        
        clear() -- completely empties and frees a list (avoiding memory leaks)

        push() -- adds value to the beginning of the list

        pop() -- removes and returns value from the beginning of list

        enqueue() -- adds value to the beginning of the list

        dequeue() -- removes and returns value from the end of the list
