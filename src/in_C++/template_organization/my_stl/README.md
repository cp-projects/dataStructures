This is my attempt to learn more about the c++ standard tamplate liberary by writing my own versions of some of their code (Ideally checking the original ocassionally rather than copying directly)

Current goal:
    recreate enough functionality of the <iterator> header and the fill method from <algorithm> to get my stack_array working and initialized with 0s.
