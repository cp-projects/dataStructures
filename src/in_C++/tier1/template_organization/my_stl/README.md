This is my attempt to learn more about the c++ standard tamplate liberary by writing my own versions of some of their code (Ideally checking the original ocassionally rather than copying directly)

Translating my names:

my -- evenually going to be a namespace to distinguish from stl

static-stack-array -- equivalent to the <array> class

dynamic-heap-array -- equivalent to the <vector> class

Current goal:
    Get my array class to recognize bracket surrounded array literals
